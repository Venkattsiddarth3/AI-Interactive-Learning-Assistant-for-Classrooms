# AI-Interactive-Learning-Assistant-for-Classrooms
<br>

## Overview

This project builds an AI-powered multimodal assistant designed for classrooms, integrating:

 - **Natural Language Understanding** ‚Äî Answers open-ended student questions via local TinyLlama LLM.
 
 - **Voice Interaction** ‚Äî Accepts spoken queries, converts them to text, and generates natural responses with TTS playback.
 
 - **Visual Intelligence** ‚Äî Extracts text from images using OCR, enabling students to upload notes, equations, or diagrams.
 
-  **Emotion Detection** ‚Äî Monitors student facial expressions via webcam to assess engagement and Interactivity.Designed to help teachers personalize lessons, identify disengaged students and create a truly interactive learning environment.

 ## How It Works
 
-  **üé§ Multimodal AI Assistant**

    - **üåê Text & Voice Queries:**
Students ask questions via text or voice. The assistant processes the query using a local TinyLlama LLM (Mistral-7B or TinyLlama-1.1B), providing rich, contextual answers.

    - **üñº Image-Based Input:**
              Upload handwritten notes or screenshots. The assistant extracts text using Tesseract.js OCR and incorporates it into the conversation.

    - **üòä Emotion Recognition:**
            - Uses OpenCV and facial landmarks to detect emotions from webcam snapshots.
            - Helps identify when students are confused or losing interest in real time.

## üåê Web Interface
 **Use the intuitive frontend to:**

   - Ask questions via typing or microphone.

   - Upload images for OCR.

   - See real-time emotion analysis.

 ## Key Features
 
- **AI Chat Assistant**
 
    - Answers factual or open-ended academic questions.

    - Keeps track of chat history & logs for teachers.
 - **Speech + TTS**

    - Converts speech to text in real time.

    - Replies with human-like speech synthesis.

- **Image Query Support**

    - Handles handwritten equations or textbook photos via OCR.

 - **Emotion-Based Engagement**

    - Analyzes live webcam feed to spot disengagement.

    - Flags when the majority of students appear confused or bored.
